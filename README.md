# Mouse Trap (video game)
Mouse Trap is a 1981 arcade maze game developed by Exidy. 
The game design is similar to Pac-Man, replacing Pac-Man
with a mouse, the dots with cheese, the ghosts with cats, 
and the power pellets with bones. The unique element of 
Mouse Trap is that color-coded doors in the maze can be
toggled by pressing a button of the same color.

The game was ported by Coleco as a ColecoVision launch title in 1982,
then later to the Intellivision and Atari 2600.
